          <h1>Hello! Welcome to my site!</h1>

              <p>My name is Arely Guevara, and I'm a self taught
              web developer from Charlotte, NC. I have taught myself HTML &amp; CSS and am currently learning Javascript.
              I built this site using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Liquid, a Jekyll parser
              engine and a little bit of Handlebar. Plus hosting through Github Pages.</p>

              <p> I recently graduated from high school, and am taking a gap year. In addition to learning about web development
              and computer science I am also interested in environmental science and conservation and documenting the thngs that align with those interests on my blog. </p>

              <p>All the work that I've done can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/suavesona">Github</a>.</p>
